Hello world!

I am still in the process of figuring things out with all this borderline-web-development stuff, so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I don't know man.

My current plan is to have different sub menus for each of the different projects that I am/will be working on, which currently includes:

* Tackling Dummy
* CNC Router
* Battlerite Discord bot
* Website blocking Chrome extension
* This website itself!

Java testing!
```java
public class Test
{
	public static void Main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
```

Math testing...?

Block Math:

$$
f(x) = ax + b
$$

Inline Math: $a \neq b$
