You might remember seeing [this post](http://www.bfan.tech/2018/05/21/Website-Home-Page-rewrite/) that I made more than two months (Wow! Has it really been two months?) ago. There, I briefly mentioned that I found it hard to make the changes that I wanted to, as I didn't understand Ruby, and therefore, Jekyll. Recently, the idea occured to me that I could use a different SSG (Static-Site-Generator) and build my own blog/portfolio hybrid, using a language that I actually know, like Python, or JS. I stared looking around, and after starting some work on using [GatsbyJS](gatsbyjs.org), which is based on ReactJS, I also found [Lektor](www.getlektor.com), which is a one of a kind SSG as it has a locally hosted CMS (content management system - think WordPress).

In terms of most metrics, such as popularity, technology, growth, GatsbyJS absolutely stomps on Lektor. It uses ReactJS versus Python, arguably has the second largest plugin library of all SSG's, and is already the fourth most popular SSG a year after its initial release. It seems like the choice of Gatsby over Lektor is a no brainer, and it was, until this morning.

This morning, I realized that definitely not the only high-schooler who is in need of a hybrid blog/portfolio website. Surely there has to be hundreds, at lesast. I asked on an online community (The College Admissions Hub Discord), and found that there was indeed some interest in this. That was when Lektor was suggested to me. Because it uses a locally hosted CMS, when writing and uploading new posts, one can do so on a local instance of their website, instead of within VS Code like how I am doing it right now. Uploading posts will have a nice and intuitive UI, whereas with GatsbyJS one would have to tinker with Github - something that is not easy to use for the average high-schooler.

However, I guess the counter-argument to that is that the person who would look for a SSG for their personal website, instead of straight up using Wix or Squarespace or whatever, are probably already tech-savvy enough to use a GatsbyJS theme.

I think, as of now, I personally lean towrads GatsbyJS, and so I'll keep working on using that. However, I think Lektor is something that I'll definitely keep in mind.
